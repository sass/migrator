We have to generate a new `@use` for the variable reference in `_other.scss`. We
should generate one that uses the original dependency URL, rather than the
direct URL to the file in which the name is defined, since that file structure
is likely not to be part of the library's public API.

<==> input/entrypoint.scss
@import "~module/dependency";
@import "other";

<==> input/_other.scss
a {
  color: $variable;
}

<==> input/node_modules/module/_dependency.scss
@import "other";

<==> input/node_modules/module/_other.scss
$variable: green;

<==> output/entrypoint.scss
@use "~module/dependency";
@use "other";

<==> output/_other.scss
@use "~module/dependency";
a {
  color: dependency.$variable;
}
