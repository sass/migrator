Error: This variable was loaded from a late import of _library.scss,
which also emits CSS. Splitting this stylesheet into one containing variables
and one emitting CSS will allow the migrator to safely migrate it by hoisting
the one containing members to the top of the file and converting the one
emitting CSS to meta.load-css().

Alternatively, pass --force-hoist to force the migrator to hoist all
late imports containing Sass members, which may reorder your CSS.
