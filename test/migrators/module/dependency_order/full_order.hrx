This is designed to test the order of `@use` and `@forward` rules from multiple
sources.

The order should be:
1. Built-in module `@use` rules
2. `@use` and `@forward` rules directly migrated from `@import` rules.
3. Additional `@use` rules from load paths
4. Additional `@use` rules from relative paths
5. A blank line
6. Additional `@forward` rules from load paths
7. Additional `@forward` rules from relative paths
8. Another blank line, if there were any additional `@forward` rules.
