This test makes sure that inserting an additional `@use` rule still works if an
`@import` is followed by additional code on the same line.

<==> input/entrypoint.scss
@import "direct";a {color: $variable;}

<==> input/_direct.scss
@import "indirect";

<==> input/_indirect.scss
$variable: blue;

<==> output/entrypoint.scss
@use "direct";
@use "indirect";

a {color: indirect.$variable;}

<==> output/_direct.scss
@use "indirect";
