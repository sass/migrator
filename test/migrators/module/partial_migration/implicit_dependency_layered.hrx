This test ensures that `@forward` rules in an import-only file is bypassed,
but that `@forward` rules in regular files are still respected (so `$upstream`
is part of the `indirect` module from the entrypoint's perspective).

<==> input/entrypoint.scss
@import "direct";

a {
  b: $direct;
  c: $upstream;
}

<==> input/_direct.scss
@use "indirect";

$direct: indirect.$upstream + 1;

<==> input/_direct.import.scss
@forward "direct";
@forward "indirect";

<==> input/_indirect.scss
@forward "upstream";

<==> input/_upstream.scss
$upstream: 2;

<==> output/entrypoint.scss
@use "direct";
@use "indirect";

a {
  b: direct.$direct;
  c: indirect.$upstream;
}
