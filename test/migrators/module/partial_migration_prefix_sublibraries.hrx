<==> README
Tests migration of users of a library with sublibraries that's already been
migrated.

In this example, "library" can be loaded either through a monolithic entrypoint
that prefixes members of each sublibrary, or by loading the necessary
sublibraries directly and relying on the module system for namespacing.

When migrating a stylesheet that uses the sublibrary entrypoints, both the
library prefix and the sublibrary prefix should be removed, but when migrating
one that uses the monolithic entrypoint, only the main library prefixes should
be removed.
