# Sass Modules Migrator

This tool is designed to help migrate stylesheets from the old `@import`
functionality to [the new module system][module-spec].

This is still a work-in-progress, but should eventually implement everything
described in [sass/sass#2575](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/2575).

[module-spec]: https://github.com/sass/language/blob/master/accepted/module-system.md
